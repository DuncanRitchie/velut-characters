            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I maintain a Latin rhyming dictionary, named <a href="https://www.velut.co.uk/" title="Homepage of velut, a Latin rhyming dictionary">velut</a>. For each word, a “Phonetic” representation is generated, in which each character represents one phoneme. This ensures that peculiarities of Latin spelling don’t hinder the accuracy of the information (such as scansion and lists of rhymes) presented in the dictionary.
            </p>
            <p>
                (For example, the “u” in words like <i lang="la">lingua</i> and <i lang="la">persuādeō</i> should be pronounced as a consonant with the sound of English “w”, and “u” after “q” can be ignored altogether.)
            </p>
            <p>
                It is very occasionally useful to me to have a list of the different characters that appear in the Phonetic fields, so I made this page.
            </p>
            <p>
                In December 2020 I started self-hosting the Alegreya font on velut, which puts me in control of which characters will load when people see the website. Thus I could be sure that all the Latin (and Greek) text would display correctly, without forcing visitors to load font files that were much bigger than needed. I therefore adapted this page to list all characters used on velut, and I “subsetted” Alegreya to that list.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are Hebrew characters used on velut (since I provide transliterations of some Latin words borrowed from Hebrew), but these get displayed in the Tinos font, since Alegreya doesn’t have them. I use Google Fonts for serving Tinos. 
            </p>
            <h3>Legend</h3>
            <p>
                The Phonetic characters have the following meanings:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    bcdfghlmnprstv have their usual consonantal sounds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    aeiouy are short pure vowels.
                </li>
                <li>
                    āēīōūȳ are long pure vowels.
                </li>
                <li>
                    àèòù represent diphthongs spelt with the vowel plus “e” or “i”, as in <i lang="la">hae</i>, <i lang="la">eius</i>, <i lang="la">poena</i>, <i lang="la">cui</i>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    â represents the “au” diphthong.
                </li>
                <li>
                    € represents the “eu” diphthong imported from Greek.
                </li>
                <li>
                    ãẽĩõũỹ are nasalised vowels, such as in <i lang="la">tum</i> and <i lang="la">īnfāns</i>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    θφχ are the aspirated consonants imported from Greek, as begin <i lang="la">theātrum</i>, <i lang="la">physicus</i>, <i lang="la">charactēr</i>.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                There may be other sounds used in Latin, and more subtleties about different realisations of sounds in different contexts, but these characters are sufficient for my purposes of determining which words rhyme.
