            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I maintain a Latin rhyming dictionary, named <a href="https://www.velut.co.uk/" title="Homepage of velut, a Latin rhyming dictionary">velut</a>. For each word, a “Phonetic” representation is generated, in which each character represents one phoneme. This ensures that peculiarities of Latin spelling don’t hinder the accuracy of the information (such as scansion and lists of rhymes) presented in the dictionary.
            </p>
            <p>
                (For example, the “u” in words like “<span lang="la">lingua</span>” and “<span lang="la">persuādeō</span>” should be pronounced as a consonant with the sound of English “w”, and “u” after “q” can be ignored altogether.)
            </p>
            <p>
                It is very occasionally useful to me to have a list of the different characters that appear in the Phonetic fields, so I made this page.
            </p>
            <h3>Legend</h3>
            <p>
                The Phonetic characters have the following meanings:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    bcdfghlmnprstv have their usual consonantal sounds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    aeiouy are short pure vowels.
                </li>
                <li>
                    āēīōūȳ are long pure vowels.
                </li>
                <li>
                    àèòù represent diphthongs spelt with the vowel plus “e” or “i”, as in “<span lang="la">hae</span>”, “<span lang="la">eius</span>”, “<span lang="la">poena</span>”, “<span lang="la">cui</span>”.
                </li>
                <li>
                    â represents the “au” diphthong.
                </li>
                <li>
                    € represents the “eu” diphthong imported from Greek.
                </li>
                <li>
                    ãẽĩõũỹ are nasalised vowels, such as in “<span lang="la">tum</span>” and “<span lang="la">īnfāns</span>”.
                </li>
                <li>
                    θφχ are the aspirated consonants imported from Greek, as begin “<span lang="la">theātrum”</span>, “<span lang="la">physicus</span>”, “<span lang="la">charactēr</span>”.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                There may be other sounds used in Latin, and more subtleties about different realisations of sounds in different contexts, but these characters are sufficient for my purposes of determining which words rhyme.
