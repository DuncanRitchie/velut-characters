# Characters in velutâ€™s Phonetic fields.
https://velut-characters.netlify.app/

A webpage that lists, and gives a very brief explanation of, the characters that my Latin rhyming dictionary ([velut](https://github.com/DuncanRitchie/velut)) uses internally to represent the different sounds in Latin words.

The JavaScript file, if the reference to it in the HTML were to be uncommented, would update the list of characters to be the list of distinct characters in the constants `phoneticData` and `allCharsData`.

Not very interesting to anyone except me, and not particularly useful to me either!
